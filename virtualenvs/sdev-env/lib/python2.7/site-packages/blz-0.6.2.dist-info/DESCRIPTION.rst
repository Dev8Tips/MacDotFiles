BLZ is a chunked container for numerical data.  Chunking allows for
efficient enlarging/shrinking of data container.  In addition, it can
also be compressed for reducing memory/disk needs.  The compression
process is carried out internally by Blosc, a high-performance
compressor that is optimized for binary data.
